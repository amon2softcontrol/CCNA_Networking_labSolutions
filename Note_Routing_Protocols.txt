Static vs default
static - exit interface  AD 0 (higher priority)
static - next hop        AD 1 (lower priority)

Load balancing
this is the ability of a router to distribute packets among multiple same cost paths
-1  bottleneck
-2  speed up
-3  security


Administrative distance: numeric value specifying the preference of a particular route
**Routing Protocol ID**  lower the AD, higher the priority
EIGRP = 90

Distance vector routing (RIP(15 hops) vs IGRP(255 hops))

FLSM VS VLSM
 |       |-> classless RIP2 
 |
 |->classful RIP1 default subnet mask is assumed 

RIP   = 120  Routing Interface protocol
Use hop count as a metric, 15 is the maximum (16 is unreachable(infinity))

NO reason to send updates to pc , save bandwidth and prevent sniffing

RIP2 -- variable length subnet mask is also send as the information
Routing loops probelm :
		--Untill hop increased to 16 or 
		--TTL of the packet expires 255 hops(8bits). 
		--Split Horizon Rule , not allow update back even if timer reaches 30 seconds
		--Split Horizon Rule with poison reverse, allows but with unreachable information

In most networking environments, RIP is not the preferred choice for routing as its time to converge and scalability are poor compared to EIGRP, OSPF, or IS-IS.
However, it is easy to configure, because RIP does not require any parameters unlike other protocols.



normally when you want to go the destination , normally metric is used to check which
route is the best route. 
When get deeper, Routing protocol actually uses administrative prior to using metric
	 
	- Network Discovery (Timer by rip)
	- Routing concergence :
 				when all routing tables in the network has same network information
			Reacged by:
				speed of broadcasting
				speed of route calculation
	- Periodic updates (RIPv1) 
		Using Timers : update timer, invalid timer, holddown timer, flush timer
