no ip cef	Disable ip cef to test connectivity
Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF) is advanced, Layer 3 IP switching technology.
CEF optimizes network performance and scalability for networks with large and dynamic traffic patterns,
such as the Internet, on networks characterized by intensive Web-based applications, or interactive sessions.

Every router has a virtual interface 
Loopback interfaces are for testing purposes
Routing protocol uses ip of loopback interfaces at the router ID (as the virtual interfaces never fails)

For OSPF....



Objectives

Load provided scripts onto the routers.
Examine the current status of the network.
Configure RIPv2 on all routers.
Examine the automatic summarization of routes.
Examine routing updates with debug ip rip.
Disable automatic summarization.
Examine the routing tables.
Verify network connectivity.
Document the RIPv2 configuration.


discontiguous network : 
subnets are physically and logically divided by at least
one other classful or major network


not node balancing
because of load-balancing, success only 50%  problem of the version 1
auto summary (disable the auto-summary)
